Setup for complex_generator.py:

Dictates the values of the voltage source. 
There are 2 modes var and const:
    const: 1 constant voltage given after comma.
    var: A variable piecewise linear function. Takes time voltage pairs separated by a space. 
         The voltage output is interpolated between pairs.
Examples
    const, 262.5k  ---  Constant value of 262.5kV 
    var, 0 0 1 400k 14400 400k 14401 0  ---  Voltage starts at 0V and rises to 400kV over 1 second.
                                             The voltage stays at 400kV for 4 hours then it drops
                                             back to 0V over 1 second.

The value of the resistance in series with the voltage source. Defaults to 0 if left out.
parasitic resistance = 10

Time to start saving data, the end of the simulation and the maximum time step.
time start = 0
time stop = 4500
time step = 0.5

The number of consecutive points that can be combined in the export file. Larger numbers result in a 
smaller export file. Defaults to 16 if left out.
compression = 1
