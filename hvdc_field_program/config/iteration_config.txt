Setup for iteration.py:
File location holding time-temperature data for each layer of the cable. Ensure any slashes are forward '/'.
temperature data csv = D:/Work/CCI/hvdc_field_program/datafiles/tempdata_example.csv

Format of the output files where {} is the number of the iteration
output file name format = D:/Work/CCI/hvdc_field_program/dump/test_run_{}

Number of times that the program is rerun
number of iterations = 3

Data for the radii of the layers in the form: start, stop, difference
radius data = 22.375,40.7,1.8325

Data for the resistors R1 --> R5
resistivty data = 3.33333E+16,1.43062E+13,4.56621E+13,1.47493E+14,3.15457E+14
temperature coefficient of resistivity data = 0.113,0.0062,0.01,0.011,0.0076

Value used in the field dependancy of resistance
gamma = 0.03

File containing the capacitance values as required by complex_generator.py
capacitances = D:/Work/CCI/hvdc_field_program/datafiles/capacitance_example.csv

Comma separated list of times which are of interest. The field at these points will be output in a smaller csv file.
times = 0,3600,4500
